Running "make" in this folder creates the base docker image, polyactis/accucopy:18, with all dependent packages but without the accucopy binary.

Running "make" in the subfolder "updateDocker" adds the binaries to the docker image, thus completing the image.


# first to generate the base image: polyactis/accucopy:18
$ make

# then to add binaries to polyactis/accucopy
$ cd updateDocker; make
